## Introduction ##

A small project to simulate the appearance of a candle or other small fire using pulse width modulation and an ATtiny84A microcontroller. The original application of this project was to light a Halloween jack-o-lantern.

The firmware was developed with [Arduino 1.0.5](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and [Arduino-Tiny](https://code.google.com/p/arduino-tiny/).

See the hardware design and circuit description [on GitHub](http://goo.gl/5VZZYZ).
